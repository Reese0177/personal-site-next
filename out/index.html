My name is Reese.</h1><a class="btn">Learn About Me</a></section><section id="bio"><div><div class="row"><div class="styles_column__ygFnr column"><h2 class="columnHeader">Past</h2><p>I have had an interest in computers and technology for as long as I can remember. My first related memory is of a toy Superman laptop that I loved as a kid. From there, I started teaching myself Python at age 11, and followed that up with Ruby. Since then, I have also worked with Java, PHP, JS (including React), C++, MySQL, HTML, and CSS.</p><p>Throughout high school, I continued to develop my skills. I took all of the available computer science classes, was in a technology support internship classes for 3 semesters (during which I helped teach new students as one of the two lead interns), interned with my school district IT department one summer helping prepare for the upcoming school year, and interned at a local building technologies company as an Intern Controls Automation Project Engineer for a semester.</p><p>After graduation, I decided to take a gap year before college, and moved 500 miles to Nashville, TN (I took the above photo there with my drone.) with my girlfriend. I started studying computer science at Vanderbilt University a year later, and quickly realized it wasn&#x27;t for me. After two months, I left and began pursuing apprenticeships.</p></div><div class="styles_column__ygFnr column"><h2 class="columnHeader">Present</h2><p>Currently, I am in a software engineering bootcamp with Multiverse. Through them, I was able to land my job as a Software Developer Apprentice at ConvergeOne. I am happy to be able to say that I am exactly (if not farther than) where I hoped I would be when I left Vanderbilt.</p><p>So far, the bootcamp has been a great opportunity for me to help others. Since I have been self-teaching for nearly a decade, I have had a pretty good handle on everything we have covered so far, so I have enjoyed using my time to help others learn, as well as tackle extra challeges to further improve my own skills.</p><p>Up to this point in the bootcamp, we have covered JS fundamentals, HTML, CSS, and Git. I&#x27;ve been surprised how much I&#x27;ve enjoyed learning more about HTML and CSS. I used to think I could only do backend well, but now I know that I could be successful on the frontend as well. I&#x27;m looking forward to learning more about React, and refreshing my PHP skills. </p></div><div class="styles_column__ygFnr column"><h2 class="columnHeader">Future</h2><p>In the future, I hope to lead a small team of people, while also continuing to write code myself. I enjoy the work and can get lost in it at times, and I know that I would never want to give that up to manage people. This role would also allow me to help others learn, which I enjoy doing almost as much as I enjoy coding. I hope to be able to get to this position in a quicker fashion than most, because I believe I have very strong skills and am excited to be able to showcase them in the coming years.</p><p>Ideally, this would be in an environment that will force me to keep learning new skills and technologies, in a way that keeps me motivated. I love being able to see the product of my work, so I hope to work on something consumer-facing.</p><p>In terms of more personal goals, I would like to move back to a place like Nashville, although Atlanta is on the list, too, and buy my own house. I hope to accomplish that in the much nearer future, hopefully in the next few years.</p></div></div></div></section></div><footer style="height:0"><div class="Footer_footer__Tl1eP"><div><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reese-gosain/" class="social-icon Footer_icon__Me07u" style="display:inline-block;width:50px;height:50px;position:relative;overflow:hidden;vertical-align:middle" aria-label="linkedin"><div class="social-container" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%"><svg class="social-svg" style="border-radius:50%;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;fill-rule:evenodd" viewBox="0 0 64 64"><g class="social-svg-background" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:transparent"><circle cx="32" cy="32" r="31"></circle></g><g class="social-svg-icon" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:transparent"><path d="M20.4,44h5.4V26.6h-5.4V44z M23.1,18c-1.7,0-3.1,1.4-3.1,3.1c0,1.7,1.4,3.1,3.1,3.1 c1.7,0,3.1-1.4,3.1-3.1C26.2,19.4,24.8,18,23.1,18z M39.5,26.2c-2.6,0-4.4,1.4-5.1,2.8h-0.1v-2.4h-5.2V44h5.4v-8.6 c0-2.3,0.4-4.5,3.2-4.5c2.8,0,2.8,2.6,2.8,4.6V44H46v-9.5C46,29.8,45,26.2,39.5,26.2z"></path></g><g class="social-svg-mask" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:#007fb1"><path d="M0,0v64h64V0H0z M25.8,44h-5.4V26.6h5.4V44z M23.1,24.3c-1.7,0-3.1-1.4-3.1-3.1c0-1.7,1.4-3.1,3.1-3.1 c1.7,0,3.1,1.4,3.1,3.1C26.2,22.9,24.8,24.3,23.1,24.3z M46,44h-5.4v-8.4c0-2,0-4.6-2.8-4.6c-2.8,0-3.2,2.2-3.2,4.5V44h-5.4V26.6 h5.2V29h0.1c0.7-1.4,2.5-2.8,5.1-2.8c5.5,0,6.5,3.6,6.5,8.3V44z"></path></g></svg></div></a><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://github.com/Reese0177" class="social-icon Footer_icon__Me07u" style="display:inline-block;width:50px;height:50px;position:relative;overflow:hidden;vertical-align:middle" aria-label="github"><div class="social-container" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%"><svg class="social-svg" style="border-radius:50%;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;fill-rule:evenodd" viewBox="0 0 64 64"><g class="social-svg-background" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:transparent"><circle cx="32" cy="32" r="31"></circle></g><g class="social-svg-icon" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:transparent"><path d="M32,16c-8.8,0-16,7.2-16,16c0,7.1,4.6,13.1,10.9,15.2 c0.8,0.1,1.1-0.3,1.1-0.8c0-0.4,0-1.4,0-2.7c-4.5,1-5.4-2.1-5.4-2.1c-0.7-1.8-1.8-2.3-1.8-2.3c-1.5-1,0.1-1,0.1-1 c1.6,0.1,2.5,1.6,2.5,1.6c1.4,2.4,3.7,1.7,4.7,1.3c0.1-1,0.6-1.7,1-2.1c-3.6-0.4-7.3-1.8-7.3-7.9c0-1.7,0.6-3.2,1.6-4.3 c-0.2-0.4-0.7-2,0.2-4.2c0,0,1.3-0.4,4.4,1.6c1.3-0.4,2.6-0.5,4-0.5c1.4,0,2.7,0.2,4,0.5c3.1-2.1,4.4-1.6,4.4-1.6 c0.9,2.2,0.3,3.8,0.2,4.2c1,1.1,1.6,2.5,1.6,4.3c0,6.1-3.7,7.5-7.3,7.9c0.6,0.5,1.1,1.5,1.1,3c0,2.1,0,3.9,0,4.4 c0,0.4,0.3,0.9,1.1,0.8C43.4,45.1,48,39.1,48,32C48,23.2,40.8,16,32,16z"></path></g><g class="social-svg-mask" style="-ms-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-o-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-moz-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;transition:fill 170ms ease-in-out;fill:#24292e"><path d="M0,0v64h64V0H0z M37.1,47.2c-0.8,0.2-1.1-0.3-1.1-0.8c0-0.5,0-2.3,0-4.4c0-1.5-0.5-2.5-1.1-3 c3.6-0.4,7.3-1.7,7.3-7.9c0-1.7-0.6-3.2-1.6-4.3c0.2-0.4,0.7-2-0.2-4.2c0,0-1.3-0.4-4.4,1.6c-1.3-0.4-2.6-0.5-4-0.5 c-1.4,0-2.7,0.2-4,0.5c-3.1-2.1-4.4-1.6-4.4-1.6c-0.9,2.2-0.3,3.8-0.2,4.2c-1,1.1-1.6,2.5-1.6,4.3c0,6.1,3.7,7.5,7.3,7.9 c-0.5,0.4-0.9,1.1-1,2.1c-0.9,0.4-3.2,1.1-4.7-1.3c0,0-0.8-1.5-2.5-1.6c0,0-1.6,0-0.1,1c0,0,1,0.5,1.8,2.3c0,0,0.9,3.1,5.4,2.1 c0,1.3,0,2.3,0,2.7c0,0.4-0.3,0.9-1.1,0.8C20.6,45.1,16,39.1,16,32c0-8.8,7.2-16,16-16c8.8,0,16,7.2,16,16 C48,39.1,43.4,45.1,37.1,47.2z"></path></g></svg></div></a></div><div>Â© Reese Gosain</div></div></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"qQJkfeLV2IAHY6rm4G0VE","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
